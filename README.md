# SkyPredict
Flight Delay Prediction Model

This repository contains code and data for a flight delay prediction model. The model was built using Python and scikit-learn, and trained on a dataset of flight information from the past several years. The goal of the model is to predict whether a given flight will experience a delay or not.

Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to clone this repository to your local machine. You'll also need to have Python installed, as well as several Python libraries including NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn. Once you have everything set up, you can run the train.py script to train the model and generate predictions.

Data

The data used to train this model was obtained from several publicly available sources, including the Bureau of Transportation Statistics and FlightStats. The data includes information on millions of flights from the past several years, including departure and arrival times, origin and destination airports, and other relevant details.

Training the Model

The model was trained using scikit-learn's Gradient Boosting Classifier algorithm, which is a powerful machine learning algorithm for classification tasks. The training data was split into a training set and a validation set, with the model being trained on the training set and evaluated on the validation set.

Evaluation

The performance of the model was evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The results of the evaluation show that the model is able to predict flight delays with a high degree of accuracy.

Conclusion

Overall, this flight delay prediction model is a powerful tool for airlines and travelers alike. By accurately predicting flight delays, airlines can better manage their resources and minimize disruptions to passengers. Similarly, travelers can use this information to make more informed decisions about their travel plans. We hope that this project will be a valuable resource for anyone interested in the field of aviation or machine learning.
